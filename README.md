# nbody Simulation Problems

This repository contains five implementation tasks of an nbody simulation. Every task will build upon the previous one and is located on the corresponding git branch.

Note that some problems require you to initialize a git submodule (problem 3 and 4). After checking out the corresponding branch, you can initialize the submodule as follows.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
